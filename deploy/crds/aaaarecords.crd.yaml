              `AAAARecord` maps a DNS name to an IPv6 address.

              AAAA records are the IPv6 equivalent of A records, mapping hostnames to IPv6 addresses.

              # Example

              ```yaml
              apiVersion: bindy.firestoned.io/v1beta1
              kind: AAAARecord
              metadata:
                name: www-example-com-ipv6
                namespace: dns-system
                labels:
                  zone: example.com
              spec:
                name: www
                ipv6Address: "2001:db8::1"
                ttl: 300
              ```

              Records are associated with `DNSZones` via label selectors.
              The `DNSZone` must have a `recordsFrom` selector that matches this record's labels.

                  Must contain at least one valid IPv6 address in standard notation.

                    Condition represents an observation of a resource's current state.

                    a resource to users and controllers.

                  Used to detect when a record's data has actually changed, avoiding
                  unnecessary BIND9 updates and zone transfers.

                  The hash is calculated from all fields in the record's spec that affect
                  the DNS record data (name, addresses, TTL, etc.).

                  The FQDN of the zone that owns this record (set by `DNSZone` controller).

                  When a `DNSZone`'s label selector matches this record, the `DNSZone` controller
                  sets this field to the zone's FQDN (e.g., `"example.com"`). The record reconciler
                  uses this to determine which zone to update in BIND9.

                  If this field is empty, the record is not matched by any zone and should not
                  be reconciled into BIND9.

                  **DEPRECATED**: Use `zone_ref` instead for structured zone reference.

                  Set by the `DNSZone` controller when the zone's `recordsFrom` selector matches
                  this record's labels. Contains the complete Kubernetes object reference including
                  apiVersion, kind, name, namespace, and zoneName.

                  The record reconciler uses this to:
                  1. Look up the parent `DNSZone` resource
                  2. Find the zone's primary `Bind9Instance` servers
                  3. Add this record to BIND9 on primaries
                  4. Trigger zone transfer (retransfer) on secondaries

                  If this field is None, the record is not selected by any zone and will not
                  be added to BIND9.

                      This field is set by the `DNSZone` controller after successfully applying zone configuration
                      to the instance. It is reset to `None` when:
                      - The instance's pod restarts (requiring zone reconfiguration)
                      - The instance's spec changes (requiring reconfiguration)

                      The `DNSZone` controller uses this field to determine which instances need zone configuration.
                      If this field is `None`, the zone needs to be configured on the instance.
