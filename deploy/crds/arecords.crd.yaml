              `ARecord` maps a DNS name to an IPv4 address.

              A records are the most common DNS record type, mapping hostnames to IPv4 addresses.
              Multiple A records can exist for the same name (round-robin DNS).

              # Example

              ```yaml
              apiVersion: bindy.firestoned.io/v1beta1
              kind: ARecord
              metadata:
                name: www-example-com
                namespace: dns-system
                labels:
                  zone: example.com
              spec:
                name: www
                ipv4Address: 192.0.2.1
                ttl: 300
              ```

              Records are associated with `DNSZones` via label selectors.
              The `DNSZone` must have a `recordsFrom` selector that matches this record's labels.
            properties:
              ipv4Address:

                  IPv4 address in dotted-decimal notation.

                  Must be a valid IPv4 address (e.g., "192.0.2.1").
                pattern: ^((25[0-5]|(2[0-4]|1\d|[1-9]|)\d)\.){3}(25[0-5]|(2[0-4]|1\d|[1-9]|)\d)$

                    Condition represents an observation of a resource's current state.

                    Conditions are used in status subresources to communicate the state of
                    a resource to users and controllers.

                  SHA-256 hash of the record's spec data.

                  Used to detect when a record's data has actually changed, avoiding
                  unnecessary BIND9 updates and zone transfers.

                  The hash is calculated from all fields in the record's spec that affect
                  the DNS record data (name, addresses, TTL, etc.).

                  The FQDN of the zone that owns this record (set by `DNSZone` controller).

                  When a `DNSZone`'s label selector matches this record, the `DNSZone` controller
                  sets this field to the zone's FQDN (e.g., `"example.com"`). The record reconciler
                  uses this to determine which zone to update in BIND9.

                  If this field is empty, the record is not matched by any zone and should not
                  be reconciled into BIND9.
