              `NSRecord` delegates a subdomain to other nameservers.

              NS (Nameserver) records specify which DNS servers are authoritative for a subdomain.
              They are used for delegating subdomains to different nameservers.

              # Example

              ```yaml
              apiVersion: bindy.firestoned.io/v1beta1
              kind: NSRecord
              metadata:
                name: subdomain-ns
                namespace: dns-system
                labels:
                  zone: example.com
              spec:
                name: subdomain
                nameserver: ns1.other-provider.com.
                ttl: 86400
              ```

              Records are associated with `DNSZones` via label selectors.
              The `DNSZone` must have a `recordsFrom` selector that matches this record's labels.

                    Condition represents an observation of a resource's current state.

                    Conditions are used in status subresources to communicate the state of
                    a resource to users and controllers.

                  SHA-256 hash of the record's spec data.

                  Used to detect when a record's data has actually changed, avoiding
                  unnecessary BIND9 updates and zone transfers.

                  The hash is calculated from all fields in the record's spec that affect
                  the DNS record data (name, addresses, TTL, etc.).

                  The FQDN of the zone that owns this record (set by `DNSZone` controller).

                  When a `DNSZone`'s label selector matches this record, the `DNSZone` controller
                  sets this field to the zone's FQDN (e.g., `"example.com"`). The record reconciler
                  uses this to determine which zone to update in BIND9.

                  If this field is empty, the record is not matched by any zone and should not
                  be reconciled into BIND9.
