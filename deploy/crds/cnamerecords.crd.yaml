              `CNAMERecord` creates an alias from one name to another.

              CNAME (Canonical Name) records create an alias from one DNS name to another.
              The target can be in the same zone or a different zone.

              **Important**: A CNAME cannot coexist with other record types for the same name.

              # Example

              ```yaml
              apiVersion: bindy.firestoned.io/v1beta1
              kind: CNAMERecord
              metadata:
                name: blog-example-com
                namespace: dns-system
                labels:
                  zone: example.com
              spec:
                name: blog
                target: example.github.io.
                ttl: 3600
              ```

              Records are associated with `DNSZones` via label selectors.
              The `DNSZone` must have a `recordsFrom` selector that matches this record's labels.

                    Condition represents an observation of a resource's current state.

                    Conditions are used in status subresources to communicate the state of
                    a resource to users and controllers.

                  When a `DNSZone`'s label selector matches this record, the `DNSZone` controller
                  sets this field to the zone's FQDN (e.g., `"example.com"`). The record reconciler
                  uses this to determine which zone to update in BIND9.

                  If this field is empty, the record is not matched by any zone and should not
                  be reconciled into BIND9.
